# Plastilecor Price List Portal

Plastilecor is a small business without too much digitalization and a B2B line where it becomes handy to provide distributors with an online price list that they can check anytime with an assigned user access. Furthermore, if there are any needed modifications from the plastilecor admin, they can be applied online with an admin user and retrieved to all the other users with a valid access.
