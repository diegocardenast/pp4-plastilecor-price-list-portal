# Plastilecor Price List Portal

Plastilecor is a small business without too much digitalization and a B2B line where it becomes handy to provide those distributors with an online price list that they can check anytime with an assigned user's access. Furthermore, if there are any needed modifications from the plastilecor admin, they can be applied online with an admin user and retrieved to all the other users with a valid access.

  - Update the requirements file by running in the Gitpod terminal "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt"
  - Push the latest changes to the GitHub repository 
  - Inside the Heroku account, create a new app with a unique name
  - Inside the Heroku app settings tab, create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
  - Inside the Heroku app settings tab, add two buildpacks:
    - `heroku/python`
    - `heroku/nodejs`
  - Inside the Heroku app deploy tab, select GitHub as deployment method and connect the GitHub repository to the Heroku app
